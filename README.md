# Todo app (localStorage)

Small static Todo application using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It stores todos in the browser's localStorage so items persist across reloads.

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `app.js` — app logic

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use "Open with" -> browser).
2. Add, edit, complete and delete todos. Data is saved automatically.

Dev notes
- The app exposes a small console object `window.__todo` for quick manual testing.
